    <h1>Health Is Wealth :</h1>
    <p>Health is indeed Wealth as only our good health stays with us in any bad or good circumstances. Nobody in this world can help us in bad times. So, if our health is good, we can bear any bad circumstances in our life. If one is not healthy, he/she will suffer health-related or other difficulties in life instead of enjoying life. To maintain good health, we need to eat balanced food, mild daily exercises, fresh air, clean water, good posture, enough sleep and rest, maintain cleanliness, regular medical check-ups, follow our elders, parents, and teachers, etc.</p>

    <div style="font-weight: bold;">Explanation of the Above Exercises :</div>
    <dl>
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">1. Chest-</dt>
        <dd>For most guys, a chest workout involves alternating between three chest exercises: bench press completed in the flat, incline and decline positions.</dd><br>

        
        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">2. Sholder-</dt>
        <dd>Hold them just above your shoulders with your palms facing forwards. Raise your arms straight above your head. “When lifting the dumbbells don't move your back and in particular don't allow your lower back to arch. This move can be done standing or seated on a bench with a back for support.”</dd><br>

        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">3. Bicep-</dt>
        <dd>You can usually lift more weight with a bar, so go for it here. Concentration curls: These isolate the arm and focus the effort on the bicep. Incline curls on the ball: Since you'll be at an angle for this exercise, you'll really feel the pull of gravity at your bicep.</dd><br>

        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">4. Back-</dt>
        <dd>Begin the movement by positioning arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the pull-up bar, palms facing forward.</dd><br>

        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">5. Tricep-</dt>
        <dd>Hold a weight in both hands, extending it up overhead. Keep your biceps close to your ears and elbows pointing forward as you lower the weight behind your head until the elbows are at about 90-degree angles. Straighten the arms, contracting the triceps, and then repeat for 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 16 reps.</dd><br>

        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">6. Thai-</dt>
        <dd>Almost all Muay Thai gyms in Thailand run basically the same type of workout routines because it’s intense, hard and focuses on the all the important aspects of Muay Thai that you should be working on day in and day out!</dd><br>

        <dt style="font-weight: bold;">7. Abbs-</dt>
        <dd>If you're looking to improve your abs, the good news is that there are a huge variety of abs workouts that can help you achieve that goal.  </dd><br>
